📉 Customer Churn Prediction using Neural Network (ANN)

🚀 This project predicts whether a customer will churn (leave) or stay, using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model.
It covers the complete pipeline from data preprocessing → EDA → feature engineering → ANN model training → evaluation.

📌 Project Overview: 
Customer churn is one of the biggest challenges for subscription-based and service companies.
This project uses Deep Learning (ANN) to classify customers into:
✅ Churn (1)
✅ Not Churn (0)
Helping businesses take preventive steps to improve retention.

⭐ Key Features:
✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for churn insights
✅ Encoding categorical columns + Feature scaling
✅ Built a Deep Learning model using Keras/TensorFlow ANN
✅ Model Evaluation using Accuracy & other metrics
✅ Prediction function for new customer data

🧠 Tech Stack:
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn
TensorFlow / Keras
Scikit-learn

🏗️ Model Architecture (ANN)
📌 The Neural Network consists of:
Input Layer (customer features)
Hidden Layers with activation functions (ReLU)
Output Layer (Sigmoid) for binary classification
